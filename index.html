          "It is in the nature of people to want to exchange ideas with each other. And I believe that, basically, every artist wants nothing more than to tell his fellow people what he has in mind. With all expressions of art, whether it is music, literature or visual arts, it is first and foremost a matter of: communicating to the outside world and make sensory perceptible a personal thought, a striking idea or an inner emotion."
